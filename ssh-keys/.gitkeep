# SSH Keys Directory
# 
# Place your SSH private keys in this directory for remote host access.
# Make sure to set proper permissions (600) on private key files.
#
# Example:
# ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ssh-keys/remote-host -N ""
# chmod 600 ssh-keys/remote-host
#
# DO NOT commit actual SSH keys to version control!
